I've been futzing about designing some sort of container object -
often elements of documentation have elements that relate to one
another - a page/route may container an article, which in turn
contains smaller elements.

## Solving for page references

I want to have some kind of general purpose answer to
any part of the app asking "so how do I link to X"?
