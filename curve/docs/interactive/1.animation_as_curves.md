## Animation as Curves

We represent many kinds of animations as literal curves - 
a shape over some dimensions. We want our animations
to "smoothly" move from one value to another.

The kind of Curve that `@lukekaalim/act-curve` uses
a lot is the [Bezier Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve), which is a curve
that is composed of a start and end point, as well
as some intermediate "control" points.

> You might have seen these kind of controls in a Vector
> image editing tool - it's the same concept!

As time passes, our "value" moves from one position
to another, with the curve customizing behavior such as:

  - How slow/fast the animation starts
  - Is if animation ends with the value slowing down to a stop,
    or continuing at speed
