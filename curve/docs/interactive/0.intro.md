# @lukekaalim/act-curve

A small library to help with creating simple, smooth
animations for [@lukekaalim/act]().

Smoothly interpolate between different values/states,
add a bit of bounce or kick, work in 1D, 2D, or 3D.

This site includes some interactive elements - 
you can **drag** on many of the points on the page
to experiment with the settings and values.

All the animations are also controlled by a single
playback bar, which is pinned to the top of the
screen and also here:

<DemoPlayback />
