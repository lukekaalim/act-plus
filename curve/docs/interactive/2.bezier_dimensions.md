## 1D Bezier Curve

These controls show a Curve made of 4 points, but only in the X dimension.

> We often just shorten "A curve with 4 points" to a `Bezier4`.

It also displays the literal curve of Time over Position, demonstrating that
with the adjustment of the control points, we can change how "fast" the
animation is - how quickly it starts and finishes.

With the 4 points on the graph, plus _the current time_, we calculate
where you might be on such a curve.

The main trick then, is that each second/frame of your animation,
you set some property to be the output of the Curve + Time function.
